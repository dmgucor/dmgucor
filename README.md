### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Diana

I'm a systems engineer / back-end developer who's always eager to learn new things and discover the awesome things that you can do with code.

ðŸ‘¯ I am interested in belonging to a team where ideas can be shared as well as knowledge, you can't ever get enough of all those tips and tricks that you can learn through teamwork.

ðŸš€ My main strength is in Java developments along with SQL, although I'm always willing to learn new technologies that can boost my abilities.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning front-end with React, I find truly interesting the beautiful things that can be seen and created.

ðŸ’¬ Do you want to know more about me? find me in LinkedIn as dianagutierrezdev. See you there!
